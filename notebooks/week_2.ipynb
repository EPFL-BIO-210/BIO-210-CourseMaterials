    "### Tuples\n",
    "Tuples, like lists, are an ordered collection of values. The main difference between lists and tuples is that, while the former are mutable objects, **tuples are immutable**. This means that it is not possible to change the value of one of the elements of a tuple, unless it is a mutable object itself. To make things clear, a tuple of integers cannot be modified. However, a tuple of lists still allows the contained lists to be modified (in this case the tuple just stores a reference to the actual list, which is still mutable). In short, tuples are useful containers when the content of the collection is not expected to change or the number of objects to increase/decrease. Removing or adding an element to a tuple, differently from what happens with lists, is an expensive operation, as it creates an entirely new tuple. Tuples can be created by direct definition or from an iterable object."

The simplest form of slicing just works like the access by index, but replacing the index in one or more dimensions with 2 indices, separated by \":\". For instance, the syntax x[2:4, 3:9] returns the values with index 2 to 4 (4 excluded) along the first axis, and from 3 to 9 (9 excluded) along the second axis. You can optionally define a **skip value**: the syntax x[2:9:2] will select only every second element between 2 and 9. It is often useful to leave one or more values empty. x[:4] means \"from the start up to 4\", while x[3:] means \"from 3 up to the end\". x[:, 3] would return the full column 3.

# Visualization and docstrings

This week, we will include visualizations and also write docstrings for all functions. As a reminder, you should release your code every week as detailed in the [release section](release_notes.md). Watch out for our code review, you can already integrate the updates in your version.

Please refer to the lecture notes for details on visualization and documentation.

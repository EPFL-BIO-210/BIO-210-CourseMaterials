# Project introduction

This week the projects start! Information on the projects can be found in the problem set below. We already formed groups of 2-3 students, and each team works on one project (for the whole semester). Each team was invited to their private GitHub repo, with the naming convention: `https://github.com/EPFL-BIO-210/BIO-210-23-team-ABC`. Only one dedicated student assistant, the TAs and Alexander will have access.

Over the course of the semester these projects will be developed and various features will be added. You should release your code every week as detailed in the [release section](release_notes.md).

# Functionify

This week, we will refactor our projects into more modular form using functions. As a reminder, you should release your code every week as detailed in the [release section](release_notes.md). This weeks version will get a code review from us!

Please refer to the lecture notes for a deeper dive into functions, `def`, scoping, namespaces, LEGB rule, global as well as Python's argument matching rules. Afterwards, have a look at this week's handout below.

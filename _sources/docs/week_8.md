# Testing

This week we will extend the documentation by adding examples of the expected behavior of the fuctions, which will also serve as tests. We will also see how to create unit tests with pytest. As a reminder, you should release your code every week as detailed in the [release section](../docs/release_notes.md).

Please refer to the lecture notes for details on testing with doctest and pytest.
